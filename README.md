Random Multimodel Deep Learning using GA for Text Classification

Building the perfect deep learning network involves a hefty amount of art to accompany sound science. One way to go about finding the right hyperparameters is through trial and error, but thereâ€™s a better way!
Hyperparameters are the variables which are set before training and determine the network structure & how the network is trained. (eg : learning rate, batch size, number of epochs). Fine tuning of hyperparameters can be done by : Search Algorithm (Manual Search, Grid Search, Random Search, etc)
Here, we try to some improvement by applying a Genetic Algorithm to evolve a network with the goal of achieving optimal hyperparameters.
